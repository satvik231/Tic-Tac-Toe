# Tic Tac Toe Game

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## How to Play

1. **Open the Game**: Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. **Game Setup**: Two players take turns to mark spaces in a 3x3 grid. One player is assigned 'X' and the other 'O'.
3. **Win Condition**: The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
4. **Tie**: If all spaces are filled without any player achieving a win condition, the game is a tie.
5. **Restart**: You can restart the game at any time by clicking the "Restart" button.
